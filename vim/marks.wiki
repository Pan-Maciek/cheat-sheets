= Vim/marks =

A *mark* allows you to record your current position so you can return to it later.
There is no visible indication of where marks are set.

Each file has a set of marks identified by _(lowercase)_ letters.
In addition there is a global set of marks identified by _(uppercase)_ letters.


== Creating marks ==
* `ma` - set current position for mark a


== Jumping to mark ==
* ``a` - jump to position of mark a
* `'a` - jump to line of mark a

* `]'` - jump to next line with a lowercase mark
* `['` - jump to previous line with a lowercase mark
* `]`` - jump to next lowercase mark
* `[`` - jump to previous lowercase mark


== Special marks ==
* `.` - position of last change in current buffer
* `"` - position where last exited current buffer

* `:marks` - list of marks
